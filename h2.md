## Article about cyber kill chain


The kill chain chapter of this article (3.2, Intrusion Kill Chain) describes kill chain as a concept and also as a model in cyber security. It summarizes how intrusions work and what steps adversaries take. The main steps are reconnaissance (research and identification of the target), Weaponization (the phase when for instance malware is created), Delivery (when the malicious payload is transmitted), exploitation (the step where the vulnerability of a system has been taken advantage of by using a code by the intruders), Installation (when the intruder installs a so-called backdoor to the victims system, to ensure access in the future), Command And Control (C2) is kind of a channel for the intruders to maintain interaction and communication with the victims system, Actions On Objectives (the final phase where the intruders get to take actions to achieve their goal).

### MITRE ATT&CK:
MITRE ATT&ACK:

Tactic: In a nutshell, it’s the adversary’s reason behind a technique. It’s the answer to what the adversary is trying to achieve. An example according to MITRE ATT&CK would be that an adversary wants to achieve credential access. 

Technique & subtechnique: Technique is the way the adversary is trying to achieve it. An example according to MITRE ATT&ACK would be that an adversary would dump credentials in order to achieve credential access. 
Subtechnique on the other hand is the more specific description for the technique. It describes in detail how the adversary tries to achieve the goal. An example according to MITRE ATTA&CK would be that an adversary would dump credentials by accessing Local Security Authority secrets

Procedure: Procedure stands for the more specific the adversary implements a technique or subtechnique. An example according to MITRE ATT&CK would be that an adversary would use PowerShell to inject into Isass.exe in order to dump credentials by scraping LSASS memory onto the victim. 

(All the examples are from MITRE ATT&CK website).
