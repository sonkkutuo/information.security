## Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography:

2.3

One-way functions are fundamental for building blocks for many protocols
Computing one-way functions is easy, but it’s difficult to reverse them
If a message is encrypted using a one-way function, it’s not useful
Trapdoor one-way function: a special subtype of a one.way function, that is easy to compute in one direction but not vice versa. However, there’s a so-called “trapdoor” that can be used to compute it the other way as well.

2.4

One-way hash function, also known as, for example, compression function, message digest, message integrity check, contraction function and fingerprint, is an essential part of modern cryptography.
Hash function converts pre-image to a fixed-length output
One-way hashes work in one direction, so it’s easy to convert a pre-image to hash value.
One-way hash functions are considered collision free, so it’s unlikely that two pre-images have the same hash value
One-way hash functions are public, the security of them is because of the one-way functioning.
Message authentication code (MAC) is a subtype of one-way hash function, that includes a secret key.

### a)

Installing Hashcat:

I installed Hashcat on my Linux virtualbox by running the following commands:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get  -y install hashid hashcat wget
Then I created a directory for the task by running these commands: 
mkdir hashed
cd hashed

Then I created a big directory using this:
 wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz
 
 tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz
 
 rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz

### b)

To identify the hash type I ran this:
hashid -m 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96

And to crack the hash I ran this: hashcat -m 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved

And the result looked like this
