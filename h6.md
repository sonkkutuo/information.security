Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor:
This article listed seven things about Tor, in a way dispelled myths about it. 
Tor can be used also for legal purposes, for instance military and activism purposes, since it can be used anonymously.
“Normal” people using Tor for legal purposes, does not benefit criminals
Tor is easy to use, since it can just be downloaded and browsed by anyone.
It’s not as slow as many people think, although it’s slower than a regular network.
The anonymity can be broken if you use Tor incorrectly.

Shavers & Bair 2016:
Introduction:
Tor is an onion router browser, aka an internet browser that has been modified.
It hides user’s IP addresses, which makes identifying them almost impossible.
Tor can easily be used by anyone without special technical skills.
It enables anonymous browsing and communication on the internet.

History and Intended Use of The Onion Router:
Allows people to communicate anonymously, even if their legislation does not allow them to say certain things
Although Tor is not meant to be used for criminal activities, it indeed can be used to do so.
Tor is not controlled by the US government, even though it was created by them.
- Tor is an open source, so practically anyone can modify the code. 

 How The Onion Router Works:
The user’s route is directed via random relays on the internet.
Elliptic curve cryptography layers the data.
One layer of encryption of encrypted data is stripped in the first relay, then it goes to the next relay. In the middle relay another layer of encryption is stripped and from there it goes to the last relay, which connects the user’s target using an encrypted connection.

Tracking Criminals Using Tor:
Tor is used by government agencies to track down criminals.
Some have been exposed in Tor, but not because of failures in Tor itself, but rather from incorrect usage.
Using a non-Tor browser accidentally is one way a suspect can expose themselves.
Giving personal information on Tor can make tracking more easy.



### a)
 I installed Tor on my Linux by running the following commands: sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get install torbrowser-launcher. I opened my Tor browser straight from my applications to complete the tasks.

#### b)
I used Ahmia as my search engine for onion sites.

I searched “marketplace” and this Venus marketplace came up. Apparently it’s one of the best marketplaces on the darknet. It claims to have high encryption with membership information and, you pay using cryptocurrency and all products have been verified.

A forum I found was called Galaxy4. It didn’t have a description to it, but seemed to be just a discussion forum where people discuss anonymously about what they want.

I could not find a well-known organization with street address, but I found this Cyber Duck, which has hacking services and the street address in Los Angeles, San Francisco and in New York.
