# X) Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms and Source Code in C, 20th Anniversary Edition (Bruce Schneier). This article explained encryption very much in a nutshell whilst also including all the important components of it. 

Ciphertext = an encrypted message
Decryption = turning ciphertext to plaintext
Cryptography = how messages are kept secure

The article includes a visual demonstration of how encryption and decryption work. First we have the plaintext, which is then encrypted, so after encryption it’s ciphertext. Then the ciphertext is decrypted, so then it’s back to plaintext.

PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg (Tero Karvinen) : This article walks through the steps of encrypting text messages. The article demonstrates the role of public keys in a secure conversation. Public keys are one way to make sure text messages stay integrated and also that each person of the conversation know the messages have indeed been sent from the right person. With public keys this can be ensured. The article has in-depth instructions on how to use public keys in a correct way to ensure strong security and encryption.


## a) 
I installed SSH in my Linux virtual box by using commands “sudo apt install openssh-server” and then “sudo systemctl start ssh”. I ensured ssh was successfully installed by running the command “sudo systemctl status ssh” which it responded to by saying “active (running).

### b)
After having installed ssh in my Linux virtualbox, I used the public key. First I ran the command “'ssh-keygen” and after that command “ssh-copy-id tero@localhost”. After that it asked me to type a password. After having put the password, it draw some kind of a figure in the terminal.


#### c) 
I installed a password manager called keepassxc. The installation was easy, I just just commands “sudo apt install keepassxc”. Then I opened the application by running command “keepassxc”. There the database can be created and passwords can be stored. It encrypts all the passwords and secures them. The database is  stored in a local file system, so it’s not cloud-based. Password managers are important since they store data encrypted and keep the data secured. This way sensitive data cannot be accessed easily by unauthorized inviduals.
