A01:2021 - Broken Access Control: This article gave a good insight on what access control is, what are the vulnerabilities of it and how to prevent broken access control. It also had information about how 94% of applications had some kind of vulnerabilities in their access control. The article included examples of how easily hackers can use these vulnerabilities to create broken access control. Personally, I was shocked to find out that so many applications don’t have a strong access control. The article helped me to understand the components of a weak access control and how they can be fixed. 

A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration: This article had many similarities with the previous one, since it was also about vulnerabilities in applications. More specifically, it was about misconfiguration in security. It walks through the basics of security misconfiguration, explaining what it is and how it can be prevented.

A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components: I found this article very intriguing as it explained more in-depth why updates are so important for softwares. It explained why outdated components make systems much more vulnerable and how attackers can use it for their advantage.

A03:2021 - Injection: It surprised me that so many applications have been tested for injections. This article actually taught me some new things about injections, since I wasn’t the most familiar with them before. The overview, description and example attacks gave a brief insight on how injections work. It was also easier to understand the example scenarios when it was visually shown.

Exploits of a Mom: It took me a second to understand this comic, but once I did it was actually quite funny but also had a valid point to it. Database input sanitization is indeed important, and the systems should be secure enough so that it’s difficult for hackers to break into them.

## a)
I managed to install a firewall, but with java and webgoat, I didn’t succeed. When I tried to install Java, it said “Package ‘openjdk-17-jre’ has no installation candidate”. When I tried to install WebGoat it said “wget: command not found”. I tried multiple times to install them, but my terminal didn’t recognise neither of the packages. 

### b) 
Since my WebGoat installation was not successful, I couldn’t do this task on my Linux.

#### c) 
I used “sudo apt-get update” and “sudo apt-get dist-upgrade” and reset my VM multiple times, but it said “failed to fetch” and “some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.”. I did this task numerous times, but for some reason it did not work.

##### d)
SQLZoo: I completed 0 select basics and 2 select from world. The basics were very easy and fun. The number 2 was already a bit more tricky but still manageable. I will continue to practise those to improve at it.

###### e) 
 I created an account in PortSwigger, and tried to find the right lab by searching for it. I did find it but I didn’t know where to actually enter the lab and try the solutions. To compromise, I took the solution in the solution box and looked for information about it. I wanted to know more about what it actually is and why it’s so dangerous. I found a good article about it which is linked in my source list!
