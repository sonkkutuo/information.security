I had difficulties with opening the virtual machine. I had installed it successfully last wednesday and everything went right. When I opened the virtualbox on friday to do the homework, it didn't recognise the vm I had created. I tried with all the files related to the vm, but all it said was "Can't open the machine.". So it didn't have the start button and overall could'n find the corrct machine. Luckily, after sstruggling I managed to find it with the help of my dad. The files where kind of all over the place, and that's why the virtual box didn't find the correct one. Thanks to my dad, because I have no clue how he found it and successfully connected it to the virtualbox, but I definitely learned new things through that. 

### Articles

The article about installation of debian virtual box walks through all the steps of successfully installing debian on a virtual environment, in this case, virtualbox. It includes all crucial information and details related to the installation, and helped me to install it and make it work. The guide was very much necessary, because the process included a lot of different steps and details. 

The revision of command line basics lists all the basic commands that are needed especially in a virtual environment, where commands can execute different operations easily. However, using the right kind of a command and right characters is crucial in order to make them execute the wanted results. This article helped me to understand differences between each command and helped a lot.

#### Task a)

In this task the goal was to ensure the virtual machine is disconnected from the internet. It’s important to disable any kind of connection, since that’s the only way to operate with anything safely and legally. At first when I used “ping 1.1.1.1” and “ping 8.8.8.8” it said that some packets went through, so I tried multiple times. After I disabled internet connection from the settings and then used those commands, it said that the internet was unreachable. 
I also used these commands a few times while trying the port scanning just to make sure the vm is 100% offline.

##### Task b&c

I tried port scanning my local host multiple times. I used all the commands that should work, reset my virtual machine but still couldn’t manage to port scan. It said that the command is not found. Then I noticed that when I was installing nmap, my vm was offline. So I connected to the network while installing and then reset my vm again, tried “sudo nmap -A localhost”, but still didn’t work. All in all I tried my very best and spent a lot of time trying to make it work, but didn’t succeed. Clearly something was wrong, because it should work, but I really could not figure it out. 
The same for this one. I didn’t manage to install it or make it work. In this one I also tried all the commands, online then offline, reset the vm. I was patient with trying everything I could in both of the port scanning tasks, and obviously not succeeding is part of the process and I cannot wait to figure out what went wrong and why. 

###### Over the wire bandit
Over the wire bandit: The levels 0-4 were focused on practising the usage of somewhat basic commands like ls, cd, cat, file, du and find. These commands were the ones needed to solve the levels from 0-4.
